Looking for more info, or have a bug report or suggestion? Check out the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GQ5kVyU).

## Contributing

Until launch, this whole thing was a one-developer hack job. I'm always happy to have new contributors, so if you think you can make it better, then feel free to open a PR. You can also come by the discord to discuss or get help on development.

## Development

### Build

To build and start up locally, run:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Code style

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to maintain a consistent code style. Any violations will be automatically fixed at commit time if possible, otherwise if they need manual attention, the commit will fail with a message letting you know what went wrong.

### Backend

The hiscores functionality relies on a backend api that you can find over at [os-league-tools-api](https://github.com/chaiinchomp/os-league-tools-api).
